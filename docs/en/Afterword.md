<h1 style="text-align: center;">A message from StrokeGen's creator</h1>

Hi, welcome to here reading my rambles :)
</br>By the way, I'm Wangziwei Jiang, the creator of StrokeGen.

I'm passionate about stylized rendering, but frustrated with its lacking of technical progresses. 
</br>I'm fascinated & experienced in GPU computing and real-time rendering. 
</br>In my free time, I also like to create some 3D art. I even worked as a outsourced artist for a while. 

**All these traits have led me to create StrokeGen.** 
</br>**It's a tool that expands the visions for artists, not a half-wit AI model that steals from you and try to replace you.** 

Since my college days, I've been researching on real-time line art rendering, and **it has been 6 years till now**. 
</br>It was really a long journey, and I think this is the right time to share my work with the community.

**But to be honest, I'm not sure if I can keep maintaining it in the long run.**
</br>A lot of things happened in my life, stressing me into heavy insomnia. It has almost burnt me out. 

Till this point of time, I've been working on it alone, during my free time, and I need to work to feed myself.
</br>On the other hand, StrokeGen requires a lot of efforts to maintain due to its complexity, 
</br>not to mention the new features I want to implement. 

With the current surge of AI based tools, I even doubt if there are still people interested in this kind of stuff.
</br>Anyways, I am satisfied even if it's just a small tool for a small group of people.
</br>I hope it can help you in your creative journey.

**Again, thank you for your interest in StrokeGen.** 
</br>**I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed creating it.**
